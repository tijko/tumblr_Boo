tumblr_Boo
==========

A google chrome plugin to block tumblr posts you don't want to see.
With tumblr_Boo you can block the posts you don't want to show on your dashboard.


This my first experience doing a small bit of programming with javascript and for
making a chrome extension, so there a more than a few things in the "To-Do.txt".

#### note:

If you have "infinite scroll" on under your dashboard settings, only a limited
amount of posts will have the "boo" icon to block posts.  You can change your 
settings to limit posts per page and all the posts on each page will have the icon.

**tldr:** I need to make this compatible with "infinite scroll"
